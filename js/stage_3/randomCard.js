/*

A linked list of cards are given. Write a code, to Shuffle the cards,
without using inbuilt shuffle / random functions.

Functionalities :
Create a deck of card through linked list
Split the deck of cards randomly into 2 subsets
Merge the subsets randomly, so that previous order is not maintained
Display the deck of cards .


Eg:
I/p Cards: [A,4,6,7,9,Q,J,2]
Expected Output:

Create Linked List : [A->4->6->7->9->Q->J->2]

Split List into 3 decks : A->4->6->7    9->Q       J->2

Merge the decks randomly : 9->6->7 ->Q ->J->2->4->A
